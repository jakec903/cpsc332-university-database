a. Given the social security number of a professor, list the titles, classrooms,
meeting days and time of his/her classes

<Professor Queries>

SELECT P.Ptitle, SC.Classroom, M.Day, SC.Begin_time, SC.End_time
FROM Professor AS P, Section AS SC, Meeting AS M
WHERE P.SSN = SC.P_SSN AND SC.Section_number = M.Section_Number

b.  Given a course number and a section number, count how many students get each distinct grade, i.e.  ‘A’, ‘A-’, ‘B+’, ‘B’, ‘B-’, etc.

(This needs Course Number AND Section Number)

SELECT E.Grade, Count(*)
FROM Enrollment AS E, Course AS C, Section AS SC, Meeting AS M
WHERE S.Section_number = M.Section_Number AND M.Course_ID = C.Course_ID AND E.Section_Number = SC.Section_number AND E.Grade = "A" OR E.Grade = "A-" OR E.Grade = "B+" OR E.Grade = "B" OR E.Grade = "B-" OR E.Grade = "C+" AND E.Grade = "C" OR E.Grade = "C-" OR E.Grade = "D+" OR E.Grade = "D" OR E.Grade = "D-" OR E.Grade = "F"
GROUP BY E.Grade

<Students Queries>

a. Given a course number list the sections of the course, including the classrooms, the meeting days and time, and the number of students enrolled in

(This only needs the Course Number)

SELECT SC.Section_number, SC.Classroom, M.Day, SC.Begin_time, SC.End_time, S.CWID, Count(*)
FROM Student AS S, Enrollment AS E, Section AS SC, Meeting AS M, Course AS C
WHERE C.Course_ID = M.Course_ID AND M.Section_Number = SC.Section_number AND S.CWID = E.Student_CWID AND E.Section_Number = SC.Section_number
GROUP BY S.CWID

b. Given the campus wide ID of a student, list all courses the student took
and the grades.

(This only needs the student's CWID)

SELECT C.Course_ID, E.Grade
FROM Student AS S, Enrollment AS E, Section AS SC, Meeting AS M, Course AS C
WHERE S.CWID = E.Student_CWID AND E.Section_Number = SC.Section_number AND SC.Section_number = M.Section_Number AND M.Course_ID = C.Course_ID
